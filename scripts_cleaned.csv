			SEQUENCE A 

FADE IN  NIGHT
  
MED. SHOT   DOOR OF A HOUSE   
A cheap residential district. The house has no architectural 
character; it is not certain where we are. Near the entrance 
door is a garbage can, full.

A dog is nibbling at some of the garbage. We hear whistling, 
footsteps. A garbage man comes into the picture. He shoos 
the dog away. Without pause in whistling, he lifts the 
garbage can and, followed by camera, goes to the end of the 
block, which is only a few steps. Now we discover we are in 
Venice. In the background is a major canal and a typical 
bridge--romantic background. Gondolas are passing. In the 
foreground at the sidewalk is the garbage gondola, piled 
high with garbage. The man dumps his load, leaves the empty 
can on the sidewalk, gets in the gondola, and paddles away 
with the grace of a gondolier. Now, in a beautiful tenor

	The RKO trademark FADES OUT, to reveal a road lined with palm
	trees, spectrally long and straight like a vista in a Dali

	figures advance toward the camera.  Over this scene the TITLE
	and CREDITS are SUPERIMPOSED.  The two figures continue to
	advance, growing more discernible all the time.

	As the credits FADE, the two human figures advancing along
	the road are more clearly discernible.  Although they are not
	close enough to distinguish their faces, it can be seen that
	one of them is an enormously tall, cadaverous negro, clothed
	only by ragged, tight-fitting trousers and that the other is

          grey asphalt of the street filling the screen.  As
          speed accelerates to around 40 m.p.h., traffic de-

Shooting toward a small building (Hoboken Yacht Club) set upon a wharf 
floating about twenty-five yards off shore. A long, narrow gangplank 
leads from the wharf to the shore, and on either side of the wharf are 
large ocean liners which are being unloaded by arc light. In the B.G. 
is the glittering New York skyline. A great liner, blazing with light, 
is headed down river. A ferry chugs across to Manhattan. There is a 
counterpoint of ships' whistles, some shrill, others hauntingly muted.

It is the office of the longshoremen's local for this section of 
waterfront. Coming along the gangplank toward the shore is an isolated

	EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ROOF TOPS - (DUSK) - CLOSE SHOT

	We see a close view of a roof parapet and the curved rail of 
	a fire escape. In the bag, are large skyscrapers with all 
	their windows fully lit in the late winter afternoon. This 
	background is used for the CREDIT TITLES of the picture.  
	After the last card has FADED OUT, we HOLD on to the empty 
	parapet, when suddenly a man's hand reaches and grips the 
	top of the rail. It is followed by another hand and, after a 
	beat, we see the face of a man in his early 30's. He is an 
	Italian type, with rough features. He turns quickly and looks 
	below him and then turning back, springs up over the empty 
	parapet and is lost from view. We STAY on the EMPTY SCENE 
	for a second or two as we HEAR the scraping of boots on the 
	iron ladder. Someone else is coming up. Presently, two more 
	hands and the h"

The dormitory of the section gang. The men are through for the day and 
lounging on their bunkbeds. DUFF ANDERSON plays checkers with FRANKIE, using 
bottle tops as pieces. Duff makes the winning move and Frankie, disgusted, 
turns over the board. He saunters over to JOCKO, who is shaving in a broken 
mirror. Frankie watches him with a grin.

	Go to hell, Frankie.

	Man, you sure one ugly cat!

He takes the cigarettes Jocko has rolled, sailor-style, into the sleeve of 
his T-shirt.

	The CAMERA is at floor level. A young man enters but we
	see only his shoes and the cuffs of his pants. We TRACK
	with him as he walks across the room and stops at a record
	player. Pause. We HEAR a record drop and begin playing
	a light classical melody. The SUPERIMPOSED TITLES BEGIN.
	After a moment the feet move off and we TRACK with them,
	past a low table, and around a couch to the window curtains.
	The feet pause there for a moment. A piece of heavy
	window cord drops INTO FRAME. We FOLLOW as it is dragged
	along to the low table. Then the feet move over to a large
	ornate desk. The cord is pulled up OUT OF FRAME. Pause.
	The feet walk over to a chair by the wall. It is picked
	up, carried to the center of the room, and carefully

CLOSE SHOT of TOM GRUNEMANN, attractive young

There are joyous sounds of celebration. The CAMERA
PANS around the table revealing the happy family
and guests. Among them are KLUTE and CABLE.

Camera stops at Mrs. Grunemann who sits at the foot
of the table opposite her husband. She smiles
across at him with pleasure. We cut to Tom
Grunemann smiling back at her. We cut back to a
closeup of Mrs. Grunemann  looking back at her
husband with love. We cut back to Tom Grunemann's

disappear on this cut. It appears that Tom
Grunemann has disappeared before our eyes. One
moment he is there, and the next moment he is gone.

 WE SEE a palm-lined richly attractive street in a Los Angeles suburb. The houses are set back from the street; the street itself is quiet, empty -- except for a few cars parked in front of the houses. While the camera takes no notice, the tires are down on the parked cars, the lawns of the houses are uncut. A Ford experimental model convertible turns corner INTO VIEW. It drives at a medium speed.

 In the pitch darkness of an old shivery east coast cellar, the audience sits amongst SILENCE. Then... Rising from the THEATRE'S REAR SPEAKERS...faint tiny claws, many, moving as one, scuttle; seemingly in the roof of the THEATRE. CHEWING. SCRATCHING. TEARING.

 There are rats in the basement!
 The scuttling stops. Silence. Beat; another, then...a metal doorknob, distinctive to a classic antiquated house, CLACKS and echoes. O.S., A door slowly squeaks open.
 From an upstairs room, a rhomboidal patch of light creeps across the TOP RIGHT OF FRAME. Within the light holds the hesitant shadow of an average sized man at the summit of a flight of stairs, descending into a cold, dark cellar.
 
 O.S., a light switch FLIPS. A FLASH! An exaggerated POP! The light bulb blows in the f.g., a"

The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black

simple words in white lettering:

While this remains, we hear: ""I believe in America.""
Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a
man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great
emotion.

As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

THE EXORCIST



EXTERIOR- IRAQ- EXCATVATION SITE- NINEVEH- DAY 

Pickaxes and shovels weld into the air as hundreds of excavators 
tear at the desert. The camera pans around the area where 
hundreds of Iraqi workmen dig for ancient finds. The caption 
Northern Iraq appears at the bottom of the screen as the digging 
continues. The camera then follows a young boy running bare foot 
over the rocky mounds. He comes to a stop and the camera is 
positioned in between the boys legs looking at and aging man also 
digging. 

YOUNG BOY
(In Iraqi language)
They've found something... small pieces. 

MERRIN
(In Iraqi language)
Where? 

YOUNG BOY
(In Iraqi language)
At the base of the mound. 

The boy runs off and the old man pulls himself to his feet to 
follow. The old man walks to the base of the mound where another 
man who looks in command is there to greet him. 

MAN
(In Iraqi language)
Some interesting finds. Lamps"

	On a distant, rainy hill, the old Frankenstein castle, as

	Now we are just outside a rain-splattered window of the
	study.  We LOOK IN and SEE:

	An open coffin rests on a table we can not see it's contents.

		Dramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface.
		A dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the
		distance.  Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the
		shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming
		side by side.  They are wearing minimal rubber, considering
		the cool New England waters:  ""Farmer John"" wetsuits with
		cut-off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including
		an expensive camera with a flash attachment.

		One motions ""Down there,"" the other signals ""OK, I see it,""
		and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts
		of sunlight pour into the depths,"

               -- Two well-bundled youths shovel out a suburban driveway

               -- Youths pelter a passing car with snowballs. Others, more

              TITLE AND CREDITS
 
              A piercing high note is sustained on the soundtrack as the
              main title, ""CRYSTAL JAPAN"" speeds straight at the audience
              in 3-D and seems to jump right out at them.
 
              The opening credits follow.  Ominous theme music fills the
              soundtrack, growing darker and more dissonant.
 
              The theme music slowly dissolves into the sound of a radio
              news broadcast, as the credits continue to unfold.

               EXTERIOR - SKY - DAY

               The camera is moving toward an Indian city. We are high and 
               far away, only the sound of the wind as we grow nearer and 
               nearer, and through the passing clouds these words appear:

               ""No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is 
               no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include 
               each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What 
               can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record, and 
               to try to find one's way to the heart of the man...""

               And now we are approaching the city, the squalor of the little 
               shanty dwellings around the outskirts, the shadows of large 
               factories... "

Prologue
Legend has it, in the mystic land of Prydain. There was once a king so cruel, and so evil, that even the gods feared him. Since no prison could hold him, he was thrown alive into a crucible of moltin iron. There his demonic spirit was captured, in the form of a great black cauldron. For uncounted centuries The Black Cauldron lay hidden, while evil men searched for it. Knowing whoever possessed it, would have the power to resurrect an army of deathless warriors. And with them, rule the world.

TITLES ROLL:

CLOSE ON a finely-worked Medieval tapestry.  In the
background, beyond the intricate foliage, stands a moated
castle where a troop of mounted hunters set out for the
chase with dogs and lances.  In the foreground, a lovely
young maiden heads for the forest, carrying an armful of
flowers.  The forest, stylistically rendered by the
weaver's art, has numbers of small animals cunningly
worked into the warp and woof.  A Green Man, clad only in
leaves and vines, hides behind a tree, watching a stately
pair of unicorns grazing on the greensward.

		     We move over some junk -- the 
		     rusting front end of an automobile...

THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS

We open on a black screen. 

SUPERIMPOSE: OCTOBER 30, 1988

FADE IN ON:

EXT. ABANDONED FARM - AFTERNOON

A large, run down farm.

CLOSE ON: 

A cardboard skeleton nailed to the wall of a shed.

CLOSE ON: 

A bed sheet in the form of a ghost. It's gently swaying 
back and forth in the wind. 

CLOSE ON: 

A half finished barn. A tumbleweed blows by the screen.

CLOSE ON: 

A scarecrow with a pumpkin for a head. It sits on a 
tractor, an axe by his side. 

CLOSE ON: 

A fence. A sharp piece of farm equipment is hanging from 
it.

CLOSE ON: 

A Halloween style weathervane.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT - RAINING

An ambulance appears in the distance, it's headlights 
barely penetrating the wall of darkness. It's a large and 
lonely road, surrounded on either side by a thick wall of 
towering trees.

POV 

We are looking in on the two PEOPLE in front. They're both 
men in their thirties or forties. They don't talk to each 
other, just stare straight ahead. We"

       As the MAIN TITLES begin, two sounds are heard.  The first is 
       the low, moaning WIND.  The second is a slow SCREECHING.  
       It's the kind of noise that makes you grit your teeth.

       EXT. ELM STREET - DAY

       GRAY SURFACE FILLS THE SCREEN.  At first it's hard to 
       recognize this rough, indistinct surface.  But when a CHILD'S 
       HAND drags a piece of colored chalk ACROSS THE FRAME, we 
       realize that we're seeing a very close view of a CONCRETE 
       WALKWAY.

       EXT. ELM STREET - DAY

       A SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS FOLLOW THE MOVEMENTS of the tiny hand 
       as it proceeds to lay out an intricate CHALK DRAWING on the 
       walkway.

       For a while, we are too close to identify the image that is 
       being created.  But as THE CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see a 
       youthful artist's representation of a two story HOUSE.

                        WHO SHOT ROGER RABBIT?

     This movie starts the way all movies should... with a
     cartoon.  It's not a Disney or a Warner's.  It's not a
     Fleischer, an MGM, or a Lanz.  This is a lesser known
     studio.

     ON A ""MAROON CARTOON""

     Accompanied by zany CARTOON MUSIC, the TITLE CARD reads:

 ERIK THE VIKING - Terry Jones ---------------
 Blackness. Flames begin to lick upwards from the bottom of the screen. Suddenly all hell breaks loose. Screaming, yelling. Black figures flash across the foreground, with the flames still burning behind. There follows a confusion of burning,  raping, killing and looting - we don't clearly see what's going on. Suddenly we cut to the interior of a hut. The door is in the process of being broken down.  The  camera  pans  onto  the  close-up  face  of an attractive girl who is staring  in  horrified  fascination at the door. Her arms are white with fresh dough and flour. Suddenly the door bursts open and  a wild-looking Viking leaps into the hut. He holds a sword. He looks around wildly and then his eyes come to rest on the girl. This Viking, I'm afraid, is Erik. We are  about to see him in the worst possible light so be prepared. The girl,  whose  name  is  Helga,  cowers,  and  looks  terrified  but resolute."

   	But a shabby square. Wet and misty, creating a halo

	period is circa 1954/5. The mist partially obscures 
	the surroundings. Out of the mist emerges a man, 
	gaunt, raw-boned, in a soiled trenchcoat open over a 
	shabby, ill-fitting suit. His five o'clock shadow is

	surroundings. His age is indeterminate, anything from 
	mid-twenties to mid-forties.
   
	He is heading towards the row of shops on one side of 
	the square: fog hides the square itself but the

INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING (PRESENT DAY)

LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her
early-thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very
pretty and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her
shift.  She is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter
into a bus tray underneath the counter.  It is making a
lot of RACKET, which she is oblivious to.  There is
COUNTRY MUZAK in the b.g., which she hums along with.


INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming
coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen
sink, which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some
stuff left from last night's dinner which had to ""soak"".

INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY

We start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a
splendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the
garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate
hands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large
topaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing
on marble floors.

A Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion,
dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This is

FADE IN:

1	EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Flying.  Not at the intangible height of a jet, but at
spitting distance from the treetops.  We're in central
Alaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle.

A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills
like a deep-pile carpet.  Up at treeline the forest thins to
tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the
coming of autumn.

On the horizon, the hills rise to meet the Endicott
Mountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and
jagged that snow cannot stick to its face.  This is how all
North America once looked -- raw, indomitable.

Then, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching

     right now, in early spring, it's one of the finest sights on
     earth: The lush greenery of the valleys gives way to cliffs of

1	EXT	JUNGLE	NIGHT

	An eyeball, big, yellowish, distinctly inhuman, stares raptly 
	between wooden slats, part of a large crate.  The eye darts from side 
	to side, alert as hell.

	A legend tries to place us - -

	ISLA NUBLAR
	120 MILES WEST OF COSTA RICA

	- - but to us it's still the middle of nowhere.

	It's quiet for a second.  A ROAR rises up from the jungle, 
	deafening.  The trees shake as something very, very large plows ahead 
	through them, right at us.  Every head gathered in this little clearing 
	snaps, turning in the direction of the sound as it bursts through the 
	trees.

	It's a bulldozer.  It drops its scoop and pushes forward into

               glimpses of a decayed urban/industrial landscape. Far below 
               us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the 
               drowning earth. We descend toward the rock. Sporadic flashes 
               of lightning distort our perspective of the stone. It looks

1	TITLES - The sound of a woman walking on a deserted street

2	EXT NIGHT STREET - FADE UP - We see a woman's feet wearing red stiletto
	shoes. It is late at night and she is very alone.

	She turns a bend and enters a darkened street, her heels making a
	distinctive click on the path.

	Suddenly we see a figure in the darkness - the womans pauses for a beat
	before continuing. She approaches the figure who is dressed in a heavy
	motorbike jacket... The figure turns round - it is a girl with bleached
	blonde hair, wearing a low cut, tight white T Shirt. The white seems to
	glow a little.

	Without warning, the WOMAN produces a hammer from her bag and raises it
	above BLONDE...

	Screams....

	FADE TO BLACK - TITLES


3	EXT NIGHT PARK - The young BLONDE lies motionless on the floor, most of
	her clothes ripped from her still body. The sound of digging can be
	heard, then of a knife being unsheathed.

	Her body is dragged out of shot...

 EXT. STREET - DAY
 A UPS Man with a big pot belly is walking down the street, whistling and carelessly tossing a 
package in the air. We hear the sound of broken glass in the box. He passes a professional woman.
 UPS MAN
  Good morning, UPS!
 He tosses the box behind his back like a basketball, then acknowledges another passerby.
 UPS MAN
  UPS, good to see you!
 He takes a couple of steps, then flings the package incredibly high into the air, spins completely 
around and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box. A Hispanic man passes.
 UPS MAN
  Buenos dias. Uo Pay eSsay.
 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
 The UPS Man dodges a couple of black kids as though playing basketball. He runs up the front 
steps of the building. He reaches out to open the front door and inadv"

     Version 1 Script

     from an original idea by Luc Besson

     Notes:
     The beginning is identical to the movie, so we considered 
     useless reporting it here.  It's from Mathilda's first rifle 
     training scene that the original script is totally different 
     from the movie. This version is much more violent and the 
     affective relation between Leon and Mathilda shows no more 
     ambiguities. In this version, Mathilda was to be aged 13 or 
     14

     Leon and Mathilda arrive on the roof of a building which 
     faces Central Park. They get close to a wall and maintain this 
     position. Sunlight floods the park.

                                   VADA
              I remember before I was born, wounded up like 
              a fur ball in the highly overrated fetal 
              position, luckily I'm not claustrophobic, but 
              on rainy days I still feel a tightness in my 
              left shoulder. So now that my stepmother's 
              pregnant, I understand what the baby's going 
              through, and I'm not jealous at all, really, 
              not at all.

       VIEW OF THE SULTENFUSS' DINING ROOM TABLE. VADA, HARRY AND 
       SHELLY ARE SEATED. SHELLY IS VERY PREGNANT

                                   HARRY
              Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.

              If I eat it I'll throw up."

	they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at 
	flesh, mouths locked together. 

	He gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over 
	instead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like 
	getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She 
	arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against 
	the wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear.

Color 1ST ANNIVERSARY BANNERS flap along with swirling dust and bending vegetation
as a HELICOPTER touches down on the CHEMCO grounds, within its tall fences, near
its administration building. 

The banner reads 

			CHEMCO MALAYSIA--1ST ANNIVERSARY
			  This is just the beginning.

CHEMCO EXECUTIVES are eagerly standing by with a handful of uniformed SECURITY
PEOPLE, keeping a respectful distance.

A MALE SPOKESPERSON, well groomed and David Duke-plastic-surgery handsome, talks
into a wireless mike, ADDRESSING THE CAMERA as his THREE-MAN CREW tapes.  He walks
toward the front entrance--

               BLACKOUT

               The SCREEN stands BLACK, like a chalkboard... or a grave.

               A SOUND builds, like a RADIO surfing channels. Snippets of 
               SONGS -- Joan Baez' ""Blowin' in the Wind,"" James Brown's ""I 
               Feel Good."" The music of a different time.

               FOOTAGE

               IMAGES hit the screen: ROSA PARKS, Peace Demonstrators 
               stuffing FLOWERS in the barrels of National Guard rifles. 
               Protesters in Birmingham, rallies on the White House Lawn.

               Mixed in with the MUSIC comes NEWS BITES -- quick catchwords 
               of 60's turmoil -- ""More troops to Vietnam,"" ""Bus Boycott,"" 
               ""Sit ins,"" ""Draft Dodgers,"" ""Malcolm X speaking.""

 Transcribed Script 
 The following is a rough script of the 10th Anniversary version of the movie, as pieced together by me using 
(1) the DVD subtitles, (2) the CD lyrics booklet, (3) the official novelisation and (4) my ears. Massive thanks 
to Jackie (aka Ainaweth) for looking this script over and correcting what needed to be corrected. All other 
mistakes are my own, additional corrections are most welcome. 
 
 [ Opening transitions: Exterior, London docks, day. ]

 ENGLISH CHORUS 
 In sixteen hundred seven
 We sail the open sea
 For glory, God and gold
 And the Virginia Company
 For the New World is like heaven
 And well all be rich and free
 Or so we have been told 
 By the Virginia Company
 So we have been told
 By the Virginia Company
 For glory, God and gold
 And the Virginia Company

Fourth Draft
October 18, 1995
EXT ROAD - DAY

An old foreign CAR on its last legs winds its way down a sunny road deep in the Irish countryside -

ROLL CREDITS 

EXT CAR - DAY

Two older CHAR WOMEN are in the car, searching apprehensively for their destination - 

EXT ROAD - DAY

The car turns down a forbidding road - we follow the car as it makes its way down the winding,
wooded path - 

EXT GLEN ABBEY MANOR - DAY

The Victorian manor looms on the horizon in the hazy afternoon light - 

The car approaches and stops in front of the house - 

END CREDITS

The two women get out, surveying the dark building - the FIRST CHAR WOMAN opens the trunk,
removing a CARRYING TRAY of cleaning supplies -

                                       21 June 1995

                

               AS CREDITS ROLL

               EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               We see a clean moving POV illuminated by headlights. We're 
               floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, 
               desert landscape. This gliding, eerie POV continues as credits

   ADAPTED FOR THE SCREEN BY CRAIG PEARCE AND BAZ LUHRMANN


























                                       FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

EXT.  HIGHWAY.  AFTERNOON.

A ribbon of freeway stretching into a blue and pink late
afternoon sky. A huge dark sedan, windows tinted gold,
headlights blazing, powers directly for us.

CUT TO: A heavy, low-slung, pickup truck traveling toward
the sedan.

WIDE SHOT: Sky, freeway, the cars closing.

TIGHT ON: The sedan.

TIGHT ON: The pickup.

Like thunderous, jousting opponents, the cars pass in a
deafening cacophony of noise.

INT.  TRUCK.  AFTERNOON.

TIGHT ON: The fat face of GREGORY, yelling at the
disappearing sedan.

                         GREGORY
            A dog of the house of Capulet moves
            me!

He and the pimply-faced front-seat passenger, SAMPSON,
explode with laughter.

               A hand reaches for it, bringing the receiver up to the face

Alien Resurrection 



EXT.  DEEP SPACE SILENT BLACK.

We sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars. Finally she comes 
into view:

the U.S.S. AURIGA. A massive research vessel that sits majestically 
just beyond Pluto's orbit.

We TRACK ALONG the side of the ship, and 

INT.  AURIGA

along the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two 
guards standing rigid in front of it. Full armour, powerful 
shockrifles, expressions empty and cold.

INT.  MEDLAB

Along a row of screens, where we see the first signs of life readouts, 
lights, data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens. 

As we move ALONG them, a figure-in a labcoat passes through the frame, 
then another,leading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a 
Cryogenic tube, not big enough for a human.

Still TRACKING around it, we glimpse inside some vague, fetal mass 
encased in a clear, aspic-like gel.

               a crescent sliver of THE MOON is illuminated - huge, filling

               We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices 
               gently singing ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" and a deep, affable, 
               Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:

                         parents gave him, but he never had 
                         much use for it himself.  This

                         Now, Dude, that's a name no one would 
                         self-apply where I come from.  But 
                         then, there was a lot about the Dude 
                         that didn't make a whole lot of sense

        A woman and a man, a CYNIC, appear.  Jerry smiles as they

Jan. 1st, 1996

	OPEN TO:

	A FLASH OF LIGHTNING rips the HOLLYWOOD PICTURES LOGO away, and we
	find ourselves in the middle of...

1	EXT. STORMY SEA - NIGHT

	SUPERIMPOSED: SOUTH CHINA SEA

	The dark blue waters roil and boil and foam. THUNDER CRACKS. LIGHTING
	FLASHES.

									CUT TO:

2	EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

	An enourmous Japanese BATHYSCAPHE free-falls through the water. An
	autonomous fifteen-man submersible. Almost futuristic in its design.
	The nose cone is an amazing ultra-high-pressure plexi-dome. LETTERING
	along the side tells us this is the ""SHINKAI 90000.""

	COMPUTER PRINTED across the SCREEN are the WORDS:

		ASSIGNMENT:		GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION.
					SUB-OCEANIC SEISMIC RESEARCH.
					TECTONIC PLATE SURVEILLANCE.

Screenplay by
David Koepp

based on the novel by
Michael Crichton

	EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY

	A 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a 
	tropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white
	sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.

				ISLA SORNA
		87 miles southeast of Nublar

	Two SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a
	picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
	laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
	decanters with red and white wine.

	PAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,
	reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
	surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than
	once, supervises the settings of the table.

	She looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight
	years old, wandering off down the beach.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy!  Don't wander off!

	Cathy keeps wandering.

     THE SCREEN

     Stygean darkness.

     Wet CLICKING SOUNDS. A BEAM of purplish ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT
     reveals a mosaic of moving forms... COCKROACHES. They skitter
     restlessly under the beam's intensity. SERIES OF SHOTS -- the
     UV Beam passing over various parts of the space. Pipe webs,
     walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. Thousands of
     them.

               Then two faint lights appear, close together... growing 
               brighter. They resolve into two DEEP SUBMERSIBLES, free-
               falling toward us like express elevators.

               One is ahead of the other, and passes close enough to FILL 
               FRAME, looking like a spacecraft blazing with lights, 
               bristling with insectile manipulators.

               limitless blackness below. Soon they are fireflies, then

FADE IN ON:

EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN

Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN

We're looking down at what used to be called ""The End of the Known
World."" A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding.

In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.

Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging
over a cliff:

AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.

Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up
the ice. A human figure. This is:

JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.

Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has
an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black
backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to
JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but -

below. Regaining his foothold, Bond"

			 BEING JOHN MALKOVICH

		   A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman



	INT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY

	The room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The 
	wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at
	a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a
	book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled
	""Sit."" Craig opens the book. It reads: ""sit sit sit sit
	sit..."" over and over, page after page. Craig closes the
	book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs.
	He looks at the book again. It is now entitled ""Die.""  He
	opens it up.  ""die die die die die...""  A rooster crows.


									CUT TO:


	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

	Craig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest,
	crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for 
	work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.

              nurse attire, emerges from the parked car.
 
              An unlit cigarette dangles loosely from her lips.  She heads

	FADE IN:

	CREDITS:  White lettering over a back background.  The 
	THUNDEROUS SOUNDS OF A MASSIVE NAVAL BARRAGE are heard.  The 
	power is astonishing.  It roars through the body, blows back 
	the hair and rattles the ears.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. OMAHA BEACH - NORMANDY - DAWN

	The ROAR OF NAVAL GUNS continues but now WE SEE THEM FIRING.  
	Huge fifteen inch guns.

	SWARM OF LANDING CRAFT

	Heads directly into a nightmare.  MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS from 
	German artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the 
	beach.  Hundreds of German machine guns, loaded with tracers, 
	pour out a red snowstorm of bullets.

 Song:  Put your faith in what you most believe in  
Two worlds, one family  
Trust your heart, let fate decide  
To guide these lives we see  
 
A paradise untouched by man  
Within this world, blessed with love  
A simple life, they live in peace  
 
Softly tread the sand below your feet now  
Two worlds one family  
Trust your heart, let fate decide  
To guide these lives we see  
 
Beneath the shelter of the trees  
Only love can enter here  
A simple life, they live in peace  
 
Raise your head up, lift high the load  
Take strength from those that need you  
Build high the walls, build strong the beams

 We sense this is someone's P.O.V.  The WHITE slowly disperses as hints
of BLUE SKY peek through.  We are DESCENDING through the CLOUDS as the
evening sunset weaves a blanket of orange and red hues over a LARGE CITY
which slowly comes INTO FOCUS.

 Floating HIGH ABOVE the peaks and valleys of CHICAGO'S SKYLINE, as if
being mysteriously moved to a letter on a Ouija Board, WE ARE DRAWN to

 Urban Legend   READ the February 13, 1998 draft  
 February 13, 1998 draft 	by Silvio Horta
 
 
 IMDB Info 
 
 Synopsis : After a bravura opening sequence featuring Natasha Gregson Wagner getting slaughtered by the killer with an ax hiding in the backseat of her car, Urban Legend tells the story of a group of pretty college students at a remote New England university. The focus of the story is Natalie, a beautiful, academically-gifted student at the fictional Pendleton University. Natalie and her friends are all involved in the Folklore class being taught by Professor Wexler. Wexler regales his class with urban legends, which include Pendleton's own urban legend about a Psych professor who murdered six students at Stanley Hall 25 years ago. Natalie is the first one to suspect there's a killer on campus, especially after she has ties to all of the victims. F"

            Screenplay by

            FADE IN ON:

            Black screen

            SOUND OS -- a CHOKED BACK BREATH, GASPING, lungs looking for
            air, the struggle for life and we --

            INT. LIMBO/WATER - ANOTHER TIME

            GASPING for BREATH continues, more relentless, harder,
            heavier and into the FRAME we SEE fragments, slowed into
            special motion, dreamlike, surreal:

            Dirty blonde hair lifts and tumbles; 

            Bubbles POP through the murky water; 

            A hand and then its attached arm swims, in trouble, trying to
            climb;

            And then floats as if disembodied, momentary;

            The SWIMMER drifts, then a brief effort twisting, signs of
            struggle;

            A leg pushes off the nothingness, threatened, an impossible
            fight;

out of order to reflect the final film.

            the eerie vapor lights left on the block.

            A MIDDLE-AGED AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN carries his single bag of
            groceries.  The man listens and watches carefully, as he
            negotiates the darkness between the few pools of light on the
            street.

            We won't see his face until he reaches the next pool of
            light, but he walks with shoulders hunched in fear.

            Moving down the block, all shops abandoned.  Broken windows. 
            Rats.  The man almost trips over a vague shadow passed out
            and crumpled in an abandoned doorway.  It's the crackhead we
            saw mumbling himself into the nod-off zone.  He's still

The vastness of space.  Suddenly a hole in the sky opens with a 
flash and a SPACESHIP rumbles into view.  ON its hull the letters 
NSEA PROTECTOR.  Magnificent, though on closer inspection it 
shudders ever so slightly, denoting pre-CGI model work on a 
budget.  We're watching a TV show.

5 Members of the crew of the NSEA PROTECTOR sit in the large

LAZARUS, a purple reptilian-looking alien. LAREDO is 9.  The

                         to tell, plucked from the pages of 
                         history. Tarted up, true, but 
                         guaranteed to stimulate the senses...

               about in the wind; her face is brittle... beautiful... and

The Blair Witch Project


In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near
Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary called ""The Blair Witch
Project"".

A year later their footage was found.


Man off camera: You look a little blurry.  Let me zoom out okay?

Heather:  Okay.  Huh.

Man:  Okay got you.

Heather:  This is my home.  Which I am leaving the comforts of, for the 
weekend.  To explore the Blair Witch.

(Close up of pile of books)

Heather:  Some essential reading.  How To Stay Alive in the Woods, cause you 
never know what's going to happen.

(Picks up book)

Heather: And this is a very important book, because it has the article about 
what happened at Coffin Rock.

Man:  That's pretty old.

Heather:  Yeah it's totally old.

Heather:  And this is my field notebook.

(Cuts to Joshes car)

Heather:  Hey it's Mister Punctuality!  How the hell are you this "

	BLACK

	In black, we hear a chain-gang chant, many voices together, 
	spaced around the unison strike of picks against rock. A 
	title burns in:

	O muse! 
	Sing in me, and through me tell the story 
	Of that man skilled in all the ways of contending... 
	A wanderer, harried for years on end...

	On the sound of an impact we cut to:

	A PICK

	splitting a rock.

	As the chant continues, wider angles show the chain-gang at 
	work. They are black men in bleached and faded stripes, 
	chained together, working under a brutal midday sun.

	It is flat delta countryside; the straight-ruled road 
	stretches to infinity. Mounted guards with shotguns lazily 
	patrol the line.

	The chain-gang chant is regular and, it seems, timeless.

	We slowly fade out, returning to

	BLACK

	The last of the voices fades.

          NOTE FROM THE PERSON WHO'S PUTTING THIS ONLINE:

          HERE IS AN EARLY DRAFT OF THE SCREENPLAY.
          IT FEATURES A HIKE INSTEAD OF A HURRICANE AND
          A SINGLE GOD-LIKE NARRATOR INSTEAD OF A SERIES
          OF SUBJECTIVE, IN-CHARACTER NARRATORS.  THERE'S
          A LOT MORE PETER STORMARE (OBERON) IN THIS.

          FOR THE ONLINE TEXT VERSION OF THIS EARLY DRAFT,
          ALL ""DELETED SCENES"" AND ""DELETED DIALOGUE"" WILL
          BE MARKED WITH RIGHT-MARGIN BRACKETS: ---->                      ]

	We have seen this eye before, but we can't be sure just

	DARKNESS

	The darkness is slowly broken by moving vertical lines.  At
	first we don't realize what we're seeing.  But soon the lines
	resolve themselves into PILLARS.

	We are moving past pillars.  A vast line of them -- cold,
	concrete -- marching away into the distance.

	INTERCUT

	Extreme close-ups reveal bits and pieces of maybe... a
	figure.  We see the hint of a shoe, a link of a chain, a
	scrap of tattered leather... A MASK.  An EYE.  The eye closes
	and again we are in --

	Now we hear FOOTSTEPS.  We go from black to gray as we move

FADE IN

1.	OUTSIDE COUNTRY HOUSE - EXT. / NIGHT

An ancient house, standing lonely in the middle of a 
deserted landscape in Northern Germany; lying there like a 
sleeping giant under the starry sky.

But something seems strange: All of the windows and doors 
have been nailed shut.

Text chart: ""1976""

The headlights of a car pierce the darkness.  A car halts 
in the yard.  Three MEN step out.  One of them is wearing a 
police uniform.  The men switch on their flashlights and 
look around. 

				MAN #1
		How long has the house already 
		been like this?

               INT. SPORTSMAN'S LODGE - SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - DAY

               A large crowd has gathered to watch two WHITE BOXERS square 
               off in a temporary ring in the center of a converted banquet 
               hall. One is BOBBY, the other is RICKY. They are drawn 
               together to start the bout by a bell and a hand gesture as 
               the REFEREE backs away. Immediately the two fighters unload 
               a relentless barrage of POWER PUNCHES. Neither man is holding 
               back, and the punches all find purchase in the swelling faces 
               of their opponent. The crowd rises to its feet in appreciation 
               of this rare level of competition in the lower strata of the 
               heavyweight division.

            A violent electrical storm.  Veins of light pulse outward, branching
            off into a spidery network of 

            GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS

            We are inside a human brain.  A pack of neurons FIRE OFF to the left,
            and rocket their way across synapses to the optic nerve.  Passing the
            eye socket, they speed toward a silky, curvilinear membrane (the
            retina) on which we see an image projected:

            AN UPSIDE DOWN COMPUTER SCREEN

            Neurons PING into the membrane: the picture suddenly FLIPS RIGHT SIDE
            UP and we follow the light, flashing in a blur through the iris and
            cornea until, exiting the eye we reverse POV and

	A group of dark-skinned girls wearing cheerleading outfits 
	align themselves in formation on the sidewalk. They begin to 
	dance. No music can be heard. The sound of the girls' bodies 
	is our soundtrack. We hear their strained breathing, palms 
	and sneaker bottoms pounding while they hum and count softly 
	to themselves in an effort to keep the rhythm.
	
	SLO-MO: We explore the bodies of the dancers; their bright 
	eyes and sweaty brows, their stomping feet and colliding 
	hands (dark side and light side). The younger girls perform 
	provocative dance movements, the older girls repeat them.
	
	Their bodies silhouette in the bright sunlight.

               The Rangers plunge into thick woods. Branches slap at them,
               but the sound of gunfire keeps them going. Captain Malcolm
               is still in the lead, flanked by two young men who are
               obviously brothers. The big, handsome one is COLE YOUNGER;
               the skinny one with the lopsided hair is BOB YOUNGER.

               They break through the other side of the woods, emerging
               behind a rickety set of fence-post fortifications. Instantly
               GUNFIRE tears apart the trees around them. The Captain's
               horse goes down, and the Younger brothers dive and roll to
               hide beneath the palisade.

               are gathered around the piano. A YOUNG PRIEST, FATHER HARRIS, 
               plays an old standard. Everyone sings along. A WOMAN in the

               starts giving a soulful rendition, dropping to her knees ala 
               James Brown. The song ends. Everyone cheers. Father Harris 
               starts another.

OVER BLACK
We hear labored breathing.

QUOTE FADES OUT

WE STAY ON BLACK
...breathing continues...

Then a MAN'S VOICE talks over the breathing;

	Darkness.  Then a sound...

	Click-clack, click-clack, click-clack...

	The familiar sound of chalk writing on a blackboard.

	Fade up to see...

	A hand zooming across a blackboard at incredible speed,
	forming an endless algebraic equation.

	Amazingly, when the writer reaches the end of the blackboard
	he does not lift the chalk and return to the left side to
	begin a new line -- instead he simply loops around and
	continues writing, right to left, upside down.

	The college students in his class -- all male and dressed in
	late Victorian clothes -- smile at this familiar peculiarity"

INT. CAR DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

KIRSTY GOODING looks out the passenger window as the trees go
whizzing past. She's attractive, late twenties, warmly
sophisticated. Something makes her smile. She turns to the
driver and thinks real hard as she says this.

                    KIRSTY
          Okay. Cubic root of nine thousand two
          hundred and sixty one.

TREVOR is her husband, late twenties as well. God gave him
brains and beauty. He has used them both prodigiously.

                    TREVOR
          Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now
          Kirsty?

                    KIRSTY
          Shut up and play darling. Your turn.

We're flying under the wing of a submarine attack plane, circa
1940.  Below us lies an infinite ocean.  CREDITS PLAY over this
unrelenting waterscape until we spy...

A sequin of light.

The PROP ROAR is deafening.  A Navy LOOK-OUT mimes to his PILOT,
 ""Go down, go down.""

Circling, we descend on the water.  Soon ""whitecaps"" resolve into
scattered wreckage.  One scrap winks at us again.  It's a small

               OVER A BLACK SCREEN:

               We hear the tinkling of an old-fashioned MUSIC BOX. It's 
               playing the familiar childhood melody of ""OLD MACDONALD HAD

               There's something a little eerie and dissonant about it.

               In the background, we hear the sound of FARM ANIMALS... a

 The real life Elf and Workshop of the drawing we have just seen.  PAPA ELF, 540 years old or roughly 55 in human years, is surrounded by scores of strange and specific tools and some scattered half-built toys.

https://web.archive.org/web/20131219023653/http://www.youknow-forkids.com/ladykillers.txt,"""THE LADYKILLERS""

                                      Screenplay by

                                 Joel Coen and Ethan Coen

                                 Based on the 1955 movie

                                    ""The Ladykillers""

                                     by William Rose

                

               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY

               A BOAT

               Specifically, a garbage scow.

               We see it from ON HIGH, chugging down the placid but mighty 
               Mississippi.

               Head credits play over COVERAGE of the garbage scow. No sound, 
               except for an incongruously heroic score.

               The COVERAGE is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with 
               the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film 
               rather than a feature.

               One piece of sound -- the toot of the boat's horn -- is 
               obviously library. And not a new library either.

              LYNN, asleep, squirms on the bed. She's early thirties, very
              pretty, thin-bodied. She MUMBLES in discomfort.
 
              IN HER DREAM
 
              is A YOUNG GIRL in the back seat of a station wagon. She
              plays with a Barbie, shows it toward CAMERA at the people O.S.
 
              Someone SHOUTS, high-pitched but distorted in a dream-like
              fashion.

                        Henry, watch out--!
 
              The young girl's eyes move up from her Barbie toward the
              front of the car--slow, too slow.
 
              EVERYTHING SPEEDS UP, the frame shaking like an epileptic

               A pure white screen. Idyllic stillness. All of it looking and
               feeling like the heavens are supposed to.

               After some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen
               and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest
               this is a man's P.O.V. Then, suddenly, the white screen is
               tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead
               man.

               One might describe the scene as beautiful, if one could get 
               by the child's coffin.

               A wooden sign in the dirt reads.

                               ""Here lies Daniel Nicholson.

               A wilting man in his late forties sits on the grass next to 
               the much too small box.

INT. KAT�S BEDROOM - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

The woman is KAT ELLIS, 30. Tears stream down her face as
she sits cross-legged amid the detritus of a packing frenzy.

There is an unfortunate green bridesmaid�s dress hanging on
the back of the door.

Kat sits bolt upright, wide eyed. She looks around in

               FADE IN:

               INT. BASEMENT - HANDHELD SHOT - DANIEL'S POV - NIGHT

               A dingy floor, a beer bottle, a notebook of scribbles.  A 
               feeling of uneasiness.

               SLURP CHUG SPLASH

               A shaky hand sets down a beer bottle.

               THUD THUD THUD

               Someone is walking heavily down a stair case nearby.

               PAN TO - CASEY SMITH

               A regular looking guy with a soccer ball in hand and a 
               slightly exasperated expression approaches.

 My Pure Joy  READ the script 
 Undated, Unspecified draft script by  James Cullen Bressack 
 
 IMDB Info 
 
 Synopsis : On the outside Adam appears to be a normal teenager, but underneath...his mind has been so rotted by trauma from his past and the gory films he watches, that he has blurred the lines between reality and pretend! This prompts Adam to start killing people in similar ways to films he watches, making sure to put his own little spin on it.
